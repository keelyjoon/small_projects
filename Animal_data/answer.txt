Compare your two solutions (the solution from the Manhattan
Metric and the solution from Euclidean Distance) to the "right answer".
How well or poorly did they do? Did either perform significantly better
than the other? (Your results are not required to match the "right answer"
perfectly.)

Both algorithims seemed to do an adequate job of sorting the 100 animals into
the 7 randomly chosen clusters. After running it multiple times the Euclidean 
algorithim seemed to be more accurate to the "right answer". The solutions were 
different every time, but seemed to be as accurate as possible considering the 
randomness of the assigned clusters.
